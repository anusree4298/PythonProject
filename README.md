# Employee Data Analysis - ABC Company

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing an employee dataset from ABC Company, consisting of **458 rows and 9 columns**. The objective is to preprocess the dataset, perform data analysis, and visualize key insights to help the company understand employee distribution, salary expenditure, and correlations between variables.

## **Preprocessing Steps**
- The "Height" column contained inconsistent data, which was replaced with random values between **150 cm and 180 cm** to maintain data integrity.
- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure clean data for analysis.

## **Analysis Tasks & Findings**
### **1. Employee Distribution Across Teams**
- Determined the number of employees in each team.
- Calculated the percentage split relative to the total workforce.
- **Insight:** *New Orleans Pelicans (19 employees) and Memphis Grizzlies (18 employees) have the highest number of employees.*

### **2. Segregation Based on Position**
- Categorized employees into different positions (SG, PF, PG, SF, C).
- Visualized the distribution using a **pie chart**.
- **Insight:** *Positions are evenly distributed, with SG having the highest count (102) and C having the lowest (79).*

### **3. Identifying the Predominant Age Group**
- Grouped employees into three age categories: **20-30, 31-40, and 41-50**.
- Visualized the data using a **bar chart**.
- **Insight:** *The majority of employees belong to the 20-30 age group, indicating a younger workforce.*

### **4. Salary Expenditure by Team and Position**
- Summed up salary expenses per team and position.
- Visualized the total salary expenditure using **bar charts**.
- **Insight:** *Cleveland Cavaliers has the highest salary expenditure among teams, while Centers (C) have the highest salary expenses among positions.*

### **5. Correlation Between Age & Salary**
- Calculated the **correlation coefficient (0.21)** to measure the relationship.
- Visualized the correlation using a **scatter plot**.
- **Insight:** *There is a weak positive correlation between age and salary. Most high earners are in the 30-35 age group.*

## **Graphical Representations**
For effective visualization, the following graphs were generated:
- **Bar Chart:** Employee distribution across teams.
- **Pie Chart:** Segregation of employees based on positions.
- **Bar Chart:** Predominant age group.
- **Bar Chart:** Salary expenditure by team and position.
- **Scatter Plot:** Correlation between age and salary.

## **Key Insights**
- **Team Distribution:** Some teams have significantly more employees than others.
- **Position Segregation:** The company maintains a balanced workforce across different positions.
- **Age Distribution:** The majority of employees are young (20-30 age group).
- **Salary Trends:** Specific teams and positions receive a larger share of the salary budget.
- **Correlation Between Age & Salary:** Older employees tend to earn more, but other factors also play a role.

## **Project Submission Details**
- The dataset, analysis code, and visualizations are uploaded to GitHub.
- The project is documented in a **Jupyter Notebook** for easy reproducibility.
- This README file summarizes the project objectives, methodology, and findings.

This project showcases the application of **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** in real-world data analysis.
